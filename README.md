<b>Live demo: https://dapper-gumption-fce6cd.netlify.app/ </b>

This project was built with the objective of practicing and coding some aspects of React.

<ul>
  <li>React (useContent, useReducer, useEffect, useState props, handlers)</li>
  <li>Styled Components</li>
  <li>Complex Context manipulation</li>
